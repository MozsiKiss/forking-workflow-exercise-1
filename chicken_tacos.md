## INGREDIENTS:
4 teaspoons chili powder
2 teaspoon ground cumin
2 teaspoon smoked paprika
2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste,
1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs
1 tablespoon canola oil
12 mini flour tortillas
1 cup pico de gallo, homemade or store-bought
1 avocado, halved, peeled, seeded and diced
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves

## RECIPE

In a big bowl, combine chili powder, cumin, paprika, garlic powder, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Season beef with chili powder mixture.
Heat canola oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Working in batches, add chicken to the skillet in a single layer and cook until golden brown and cooked through, reaching an internal temperature of 165 degrees F, about 4-5 minutes per side. Let cool before dicing into bite-size pieces. Serve chicken in tortillas, topped with pico de gallo, avocado, cilantro and lime.
